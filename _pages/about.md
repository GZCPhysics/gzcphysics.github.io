Hi, I am Zucheng Gao, a postdoc researcher currently at LAPTh, CNRS. I finished my PhD in the Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge, with Prof. Anthony Challinor and Dr. Zvonimir Vlah. Before that I got two Bachelor degrees in both Physics and Mathematics in Peking University. I was also first a visiting undergraduate and then a research assistant at Caltech. I took another research assistant position at the Kavli Institute of Peking University with Prof. Xian Chen.

My research focus is on cosmology, especially on the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. Like all other cosmologists, I am interested in testing and understanding the foundamental physics of our universe, including the nature of dark matter and dark energy, the physics of galaxy formation, black holes and they binaries etc. The LSS is a good playground to infer and address these questions.
